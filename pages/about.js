          My whole life, I have known that my path in this lifetime is to
          support others thrive in their journey toward healing and wholeness.
          My interest in manual therapy started when I was eight and my dad
          herniated a disc in his back. For a week he was mainly bedridden. I
          would bring him hot packs in bed and try to lift his spirits. When
          multiple spine specialists reported that surgery was the only option,
          my mom, a physical therapist, asked 2 of her manual physical therapist
          buddies to help out. They would come to the house, throw a mat on the
          floor, and treat my dad. I would watch in fascination as my dad was
          able to move better and better after every session. He was diligent
          with his exercises and now, over 30 years later he is active, strong,
          and never needed surgery! This was the start of my curiosity, deep
          awe, and respect for the body's innate ability to heal.

          As a college student I studied physical therapy at the University of
          Connecticut graduating in 2004. At school I was always passionate
          about advocating for women’s health and women’s right to choose and be
          informed about all aspects of their health. Also, as one of the only
          Latina’s and POC folks in the physical therapy and allied health
          department, I was acutely aware of the disparities in health research
          and access to healthcare among BIPOC communities. I completed my
          graduation thesis and published my research in the Journal of Strength
          and Conditioning in Psychosocial Barriers to Physical Activity in
          Puerto Rican Women. I also gave lectures at local conferences on the
          importance of healthcare practitioners recognizing the racial and
          ethic differences when developing treatment plans.

          Knowing that I wanted to focus my career in pelvic health, I completed
          the course work through the Herman & Wallace Pelvic Rehabilitation
          Institute and began a fulfilling career as a pelvic floor physical
          therapist. I have worked at the National Rehabilitation Institute,
          Kirk Center for Health Living in the Chicagoland region, a specialty
          clinic for pelvic floor dysfunction, and in 2012 I was the co-founder
          and co-owner of Body Connect Health and Wellness in Washington DC. At
          Body Connect one of our main missions was not only to provide
          exceptional care for all persons with pelvic floor dysfunction but
          also to empower the community through community education classes on
          topics ranging from work ergonomics, pre and postpartum wellness, to
          sexual health throughout the lifespan.

          After 8 years, 3 kids (between my business partner and myself), cross
          country moves, a global pandemic we decided it was time to close Body
          Connect. I started Mariposa Wellness to continue serving the DC
          community in the areas of pelvic health, chronic pain, and full body
          integrative healing.

          When I am not treating, I love spending time with my family and
          friends, being in nature, exploring the world, eating delicious food,
          dancing and listening to live music. PHOTOS
